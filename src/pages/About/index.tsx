      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I have 12+ years of experience working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        Most of that time, I have worked with small digital agencies in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I am looking for projects in the React ecosystem, I am willing
        to learn and work with other technologies (I am a dabbler in the MERN
        and PERN stacks).
