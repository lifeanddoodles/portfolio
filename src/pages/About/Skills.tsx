      <p>
        I can convert mockup designs into a fully functioning website. A
        combination of design and technical expertise is required to get the job
        done right. Iâ€™ve honed my skills to deliver the best experience,
        regardless of the user&#39;s device.
      </p>
      <h4>Back-End</h4>
      <p>
        Although my main interest is definitely on the Front End, I do study to
        have a stronger grasp on how things work on the backend to familiarize
        myself with other concepts and considerations I might not have otherwise
        when creating an app or website, and when collaborating with other
        people.
